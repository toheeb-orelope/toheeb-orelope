## 🔰 About Me

I am a Cybersecurity & Computer Science student at the University of Northampton with a strong focus on **Threat Detection Engineering, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI), and Secure Software Engineering**. I enjoy building practical systems from AI-powered sensory support tools to backend financial systems and contributing to open-source security projects like **SigmaHQ**.

I aim to combine cutting-edge AI, security engineering, and real-world defensive practices to solve impactful problems.
